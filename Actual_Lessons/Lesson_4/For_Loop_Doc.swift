/*:
Write a program that calculates the a number to the power of an other number.
* create 2 variables one that represents the number and an other number that represents the exponet
* create 2 more variables one that copies the original number for later use and an other with the value of zero to be your counter
* now create a while loop with the condition the_name_of_variables_representing_counter+1< the_name_of_variables_representing_the_exponet
* now inside the loop add the code that you think will make the program work





























your condition should be:
variable+1 < variable2
